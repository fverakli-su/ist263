    <strong>Self-Reflection</strong><br>
    I've battled with the internal conflict of whether I identify more as an extrovert or an introvert for most of my life. For this piece, I decided to illustrate the way in which these sides play a role in my personality. The composition places an emphasis on my extroverted personality, as revealed through the large self-portrait in the center of the canvas, while my introverted sides are represented on each side of the artwork (with their faces cut in half). The extrovert, exhibited with a confident facial expression, is making direct eye contact with the viewer, giving a sense of personal connection—a similar effect to what people feel when around an extroverted person. Conversely, the introverted faces have their eyes closed, symbolizing the way in which I close myself off from society when my introverted mood kicks in. I produced these faces with dull colors in order to give some insight into the emotions I feel during those times.<br>

<strong>Turma da Fernanda (Fernanda's gang)</strong><br>
    When approaching this project, I was inspired by surrealist collages and created a collage that would reflect three different aspects of my childhood: my favorite Brazilian comic book (Turma da Mônica), the relationship with my younger sister, and living in Brazil. I utilized pages from the comic book that had a beach theme and integrated images of my sister and I as toddlers into the artwork. Moreover, I implemented the unrealistic scale aspect of surrealist art and played around with the proportions of the Sugar Loaf mountain of Rio de Janeiro, a mountain I grew up visiting—and had my sister and I lay down on it. I also incorporated a large-scale image of myself looking down at the mountain. A-Ha’s music video “Take on me” also inspired me, with its mixture of live-action and pencil-sketch animation sequences.<br>

<p>
<strong>Dementia</strong><br>
   This piece demonstrates the effects of dementia on my maternal grandmother. I utilized an image of her that displays utter confusion on her face, an expression that has unfortunately grown to be quite familiar to me and others in her life. I also illustrated her hands with a fidgeting motion to convey this sense of bewilderment. The background is composed of phrases that she had said either to me or to my mother; they further reveal her diminishing memory. Her lack of recollection and recognition of places has progressively grown to become a larger issue; it has taken a toll on my relationship with her, a bond that has been quite strong throughout my life. When producing this piece, I put a lot of thought into the negative space—I wanted the background to feel empty in order to portray the blankness in her mind. Despite my struggle to come to terms with her degenerative condition, creating this drawing has helped me gather my thoughts and cope with this tough reality.<br> 
</p>

<strong>Yelling Flowers</strong><br>
    This multimedia project was highly experimental for me. I began by creating an observational watercolor painting of flowers, later going in with colored pencils to enhance the shadows and give them a more realistic and three-dimensional feel. I decided to later turn this piece into a surrealist collage by having an image of me as a child serve as the vase for the flowers. I then tied it all together by adding hands, enhancing this implication that my face was the vase.“Yelling flowers” serves as a visual representation of how I feel when I’m speaking within a group setting. Flowers are a delicate thing, so combining them with an image of me yelling creates an interesting tension in their fragileness. Group discussions are a place of collaboration and camaraderie; in such a context, when I don’t want to raise my voice or force my opinion on anyone—even if I feel very strongly about something—this is how it feels to me on the outside: as if I’m “yelling flowers”. <br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Pug</strong><br>
    Pugs are a severely brachycephalic (flat-faced) breed; as a result, they have serious breathing difficulties. My purpose in portraying a pug was to symbolize my experience with anxiety and panic attacks—because during those times, just like it is with a pug, it’s hard for me to breathe. My sister even jokes around with me, with the intent of distracting me, saying that I sound like a pug while undergoing a panic attack. With this piece, I decided to challenge myself with a new technique: scratchboard art. I emphasized texture and contrast by paying great attention to the light source. The fur strands were drawn one by one, giving a realistic look to the artwork. This piece was extremely personal and served as a way for me to express my struggle in a symbolic way.<br></p>

    <strong>A Glance at my Childhood</strong><br>
    This still life is composed of items around my house that hold significance to me and illustrate who I am. Sticking to the theme of the arts, I added my acoustic and electric guitars along with two record players, which represent my passion for music. The ballerina (a sculpture I created) and the teddy bear represent my love for dance. When considering the composition, I applied emphasis by placing my acoustic guitar in the center of the artwork. I also had the other objects relatively face the guitar, accentuating its focus and as a result creating a focal point for the viewer. Using a cross-hatching technique with charcoal, I created a textured gradience. Moreover, working with a distinct source of light played a crucial role in defining the piece's highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. The use of color in the plants gives a sense of depth as it provides a separation between the foreground and the background. <br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Oranges</strong><br>
    This still life consists of an arrangement of my favorite fruit—oranges. I’ve always had a fascination with them given their shell surface and interior texture. I employed a stippling technique using pen and ink, placing more and more dots in the areas I wanted to add shadow. I found this technique to be ideal given that the peel of an orange is dotted. When deciding the composition, I placed the oranges on a table in the dark, then placed a light fixture on the left slide, hence creating distinct shadows that would enhance the three-dimensional feel of the oranges.<br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Oranges Pt.2</strong><br>
    This piece was inspired by my favorite artist, Andy Warhol. I decided to use my "Oranges" still life and produce a piece that resembled Warhol’s “The Marilyn Diptych” (1962). Using Photoshop, I colored the still life with vibrant hues, and assembled them into a square, consisting of a total of twelve images. Warhol employed a silk-screening technique, enabling him to repeat images in a multitude of colors; this is what contributed to the detached quality of his art. Pop Art-inspired design sets a mood of high energy and excitement—thanks in part to its user-friendly look, bold typography, and heavy outlines. I’m enchanted by the simplicity of the style and how the artist focuses on captivating our eye—it’s as if he wants the viewer to engage with the artwork rather than feel pressured by it. <br></p>

    <strong>David of Michelangelo Sketch</strong><br>
    During my trip to Italy this past summer, one of my favorite activities was to sit on a bench and sketch vignettes of the scenery, architecture, and sculptures that I saw. This piece is an observational sketch of David of Michelangelo, located in Florence. Upon seeing this sculpture, I recall thinking back to the Art History class I took my freshman year and became thrilled to draw somebody I had previously learned about. To produce this piece, I focused on the element's form and value and worked along with the natural sunlight—it was special as it created highlights and shadows throughout his figure.<br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Soho</strong><br>
    Living in Manhattan, New York City, has naturally provided me with a love for design and a large appreciation for architecture. I am highly fond of the intricate detail that persists in all of the buildings that tell the history of this amazing city. I decided to create an illustration of my favorite building in the neighborhood of SOHO. The style is similar to Renaissance Italianate, with the column design. I utilized techniques such as cross-hatching to produce this piece. I focused a lot on the texture and detail of the building, aiming to make it look as realistic as possible.<br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Facade Exploration</strong><br>
    For this piece, I decided to explore a new medium: photography. I took a trip to SOHO and began taking pictures of my favorite building, located on the corner of Broome Street and Broadway. I am captivated by the way in which the details look when the light hits the building. I aimed to capture a few different perspectives and shots for this piece and later used Lightroom to play around with the color grading, geometry adjustments, light adjustments, etc. Value, form, and space were two facets that I considered when creating the composition. Another interesting aspect about this building that fascinates me is the fact that only three sides of the building have this Renaissance Italianate style facade, while the fourth one has an unappealing look, juxtaposing its beauty. This reminds me of my self-portrait as they both share the theme of presenting a face which is not the full scope.<br>

    <strong>Kitchen Renovation Project</strong><br>
    This project was about completely remodeling my apartment’s kitchen. I aspired to apply a modern style and go with an open floor concept. I created floor plans, rendered elevations, and a mood/vision board to illustrate what it would look like if constructed.<br></p>
  
<p>
    <strong>Bungalow House Design</strong><br>
    This piece exercises my skills using the software Revit. The project was assigned by my school and was meant to challenge the students to design their own bungalow-style homes. I created elevations, floor plans, a site plan, a mood board, and rendered interior elevations to get a broad scope of my vision and design.<br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Japanese Fisherman Style Home</strong><br>
    This model was a school group project completed by a group of three people. We researched a Japanese Fisherman-style house and created our own with a modern twist. I came up with the design and constructed the furniture, the rooftop, and the greenery on and around the home.<br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Repetition</strong><br>
    As a detail-oriented person, when looking at architecture, I focus on a building’s details rather than its structure as a whole. For this piece, I found a small section of a city block and turned it into its own setting. By zooming the lens in on the windows, I was able to concentrate on repetition and symmetry. This artwork is dramatic, given its light source, which created an ombre effect—which I emphasized in Lightroom for highlights. My exploring photography skills have led me deeper into studying an image’s lights and shadows, textures, patterns, and composition—and I believe this building was a great case for it.<br></p>
  
<p>
    <strong>Dad's barbecue</strong><br>
    During the summer of 2020, my family rented a house on Long Beach Island. The house included a porch with a barbecue—this became my dad's spot during afternoons and evenings. He cooked for us every night while we sat at the table next to him and inhaled the amazing smell of the food cooking! I decided to capture this moment by illustrating my point of view from the dining room table. I used a cross-hatching technique to illustrate the texture of the wood and give dimension to the drawing.<br></p>
   
<p>
    <strong>Abstract Stair Collage</strong><br>
    For this piece, I decided to be a little more experimental and go out of my comfort zone. This artwork embodies different styles and types of staircases, ultimately creating a bold, yet cohesive and harmonious collage. Making the collage all black & white allowed for further contrast between the negative and positive spaces. Emphasis is placed on the center of the collage, giving the viewers a focal point and consequently enhancing its sense of movement.<br></p>
