    <body>
        I'm a communications design major interested in branding and packaging design. I am certified in AutoCAD and have experience using Adobe Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign). I have leadership and critical thinking skills. I was born in SÃ£o Paulo Brazil and moved to New York City at the age of 8, where I live with my parents and my younger sister. Some of my hobbies include drawing, playing the electric guitar, and singing. I am an avid thrifter and am a die-hard for science fiction films such as Interstellar and psychological thrillers like Shutter Island and Black Mirror.
